# Speaking AI Agent in Flutter 

This project implements a real-time **Speaking AI Agent** using Flutter.
The agent can listen to user voice commands, understand intent, process responses,
and speak back instantly.

##  Project Overview
The goal was to build an AI system that can:
- Listen
- Understand
- Think
- Speak  
all in real time on a mobile device.

##  How It Works
1. The agent listens to user voice input using Speech-to-Text (STT)
2. Spoken words are analyzed to extract keywords and intent
3. An AI reasoning module processes the request
4. The response is converted to speech using Text-to-Speech (TTS)

⏱️ Each question has a **30-second response window**.  
Once time expires, the **answer field is automatically locked**.

## Key Features
- Real-time voice interaction
- Intent detection using keyword analysis
- Automatic response timeout handling
- Instant speech output
- Mobile-first AI experience
